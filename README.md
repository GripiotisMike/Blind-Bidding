# Blind Bidding ðŸ’°

- In this Project I learned how to use Dictionaries and revised code nesting!

A Python program for conducting a blind auction. Participants can place their bids without seeing others' bids, and the program announces the highest bidder at the end.

## Features
- Accepts multiple bids from participants.
- Clears the screen to keep bids secret between entries.
- Automatically identifies and displays the highest bidder.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository or download the script.
2. Run the script in a terminal:
   ```bash
   main.py
